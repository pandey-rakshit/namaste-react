# Chapter 5 - Ignite our app

In [`chapter 4`](../chapter4/readme.md),

we refactored our code and reason why its important.

Now in this lecture we will see integrity of the app and how we will ignite the app without using `npx create-react-app my-project` command

> **NOTE** using `npx create-react-app my-project` will create a `project` with `my-project` name which is already ignited means there is all the things are done or it is runnable.

> **NOTE** npm is a package manager but it does not stand for node package manager.
